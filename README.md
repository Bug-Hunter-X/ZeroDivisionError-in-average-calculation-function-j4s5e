This repository contains a Python example demonstrating a common coding error: the ZeroDivisionError that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list.  The bug.py file shows the flawed code, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling. The corrected version checks if the input list is empty before attempting to calculate the average, returning 0 or raising a more descriptive exception as needed.
